ARP Spoofer

ARP spoofing is a technique by which an attacker sends fake Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. This is often done to link the attackerâ€™s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network, enabling the attacker to intercept, modify, or block data.

This application demonstrates ARP spoofing for educational and security testing purposes only. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
How to Use the ARP Spoofer

    Detect Gateway: Click "Detect Gateway" to find the IP and MAC address of your network gateway.
    Scan Network: Click "Scan Network" to identify devices on your network.
    Select Target: Choose a target device from the scan results for spoofing.
    Start Spoofing: Click "Start Spoofing" to initiate spoofing.
    Stop Spoofing: Click "Stop Spoofing" to end the spoofing process.
    When stop is clicked run the restore function to reset the source and target ip and mac addresses

Warning: Use this tool responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission to test.
